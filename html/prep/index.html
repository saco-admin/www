        <h2><a name="r1">First Round</a></h2>

        <p>The first round of SAPO is open for one week in July or August.  The contest lasts for 1 hour and consists of three questions, each containing usually four to six test cases of varying complexity. The questions will ask you to write and debug a program that solves a given task.</p>
		
		<p>This round tests the basic fundamentals of programming. For example, if you're familar with if-statements, for loops, while loops and basic arrays/lists, then the first round should not be much trouble.</p>

        <h2><a name="r2">Second Round</a></h2>
		
		<p>The second round is open on a given day, usually within three weeks of Round 1. The contest itself is 2 hours long and consists of either three or four questions of a more challenge nature than that of the previous round.  Each question may consist of different subtasks of increasing difficulty.  The aim of this round is similar to the previous round (write code to solve a problem), however this time you will be required to submit your code on our <a
          href="../cms/">online evaluator</a>. It therefore must produce the exact correct output for every test case in order to score full marks.
		</p>

        <p>This round goes beyond programming basics and tests elementary algorithms and
        data structures. The sections below outline how to prepare
        for the second round from learning to program to mastering the more challenging questions.</p>

        <h3><a name="r2_python">Learning Python</a></h3>

        <p>If you have no experience with programming then Python is a great
        language to start with. If you have learned Java, Pascal or Delphi at
        school, or any other language for that matter, you might also be
        interested in learning Python as a new programming language.

        <p>The free ebook <i>A Byte of Python</i> is targeted at beginner
        programmers (i.e. if you have little or no knowledge of programming).
        You can <a
          href="https://python.swaroopch.com/">read it
          online</a> or <a
          href="https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/swaroopch/byte-of-python">download
          a PDF</a>. It covers downloading and installing Python so those
        instructions won't be repeated here.</p>

        <p><i>Dive Into Python</i> is another free ebook, but targeted at
        experienced programmers looking for a rapid jump into Python. It is
        useful if you are already thoroughly understand another programming
        language. You can read it online as a PDF <a
          href="http://histo.ucsf.edu/BMS270/diveintopython3-r802.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Using Python in the SAPO after learning it the night before is a bad
        idea!</p>

        <h3><a name="r2_practice">Practice</a></h3>

        <p>The Computer Olympiad website has a collection of past first and second round
        papers dating back to 2009 <a
          href="http://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/past-papers/school-rounds/">here</a>. Some
        solutions are available <a href="../old/">here</a>. Solving these
        problems as practice will prepare you well for the second round. You
        should also time yourself, remembering that the paper is two hours long.</p>

        <p>For those who complete all the past second round papers and want more
        challenging problems to practice on, there are plenty of such resources! The
        best place to go is the <a href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate">USACO
          Training Program</a>, which allows you to progress from easy to very
        challenging problems as well as testing your code against secret test data.
        This is an excellent resource and has several problems with a wide range
        of difficulty.</p>

        <h3><a name="r2_alg">Algorithms and Data Structures</a></h3>

        <p>In the second round, the fourth problem (as well as sometimes the
        third) almost always tests algorithms and/or data structures. The USACO
        Training Program mentioned above has some articles as you proceed
        through the problems. Another useful collection of articles on data
        structures and algorithms is by Bruce Merry, the most successful SAPO
        contestant to date, available <a
          href="http://www.brucemerry.org.za/manual/">here</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="r2_advice">General Advice</a></h3>

        <p>There are many aspects of contest programming that differ from
        everyday programming. You do <i>not</i> need to check that the input
        matches the constraints -- these are only there to give you a guarantee
        on the input.</p>

        <p>Time is everything. You only have two hours to solve four problems in Round 2.
        If you think the problems are easy, try time yourself while doing one of
        the past papers. This is where Python becomes useful as the code is
        almost always less than half the length of Java or Pascal code. You do
        not need to go for the most complex solution, just one that solves the
        problem for the provided test cases in a reasonable amount of time and
        memory. The fourth (and sometimes also third) problem will require
        a clever solution, even if a brute force solution would work on smaller
        data.</p>

        <p>It's not enough to check that your program works only on the example inputs given in the task statement. Also test larger test cases (up to the highest values the input can be) as well as corner cases (which might not get tested if one only generates random test data). </p>

        <h3><a name="r2_ask">Ask Questions</a></h3>

        <p>The best way to learn is to ask questions. For questions regarding
	administration and general matters, send an e-mail to <a
          href="mailto:info@olympiad.org.za">info@olympiad.org.za</a>. For
	training matters, please approach your IT teacher, or on of the many forums
	that deal with algorithms or specific languages.</p>

        <h2><a name="r3">Final Round</a></h2>

        <p>The top ±12 contestants from the second round are invited to the
        University of Cape Town to participate in the final round of the SAPO.
        This is a lot tougher than the second round, making preparation vital.</p>

        <h3><a name="r3_practice">Practice</a></h3>

        <p>There is a large collection of past final round and even more
        challenging training camp problems available <a
          href="../old/">here</a>. There is an online
        evaluation system for the problems going back to 2002 avaiable <a
          href="../cms/">here</a>, where you can
        submit solutions for evaluation. The evaluation system is the same as
        you will use for the final round, so it would be a good idea to become
        familiar with it beforehand.</p>

        <p>Continue churning through the USACO Training Program mentioned above.
        As you progress you will find that the problems quickly reach very
        challenging levels.</p>

        <h3><a name="r3_alg">Algorithms and Data Structures</a></h3>

        <p>Algorithms and data structures become far more important in the final
        round. With a decent understanding of dynamic programming and graph
        theory you will do well.</p>

        <p>There is an archive of presentations from IOI training camps
        available <a href="../presentations/">here</a>
        as well as a long list of algorithm tutorials on <a
          href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/">TopCoder</a></p>

        <h3><a name="r3_contests">Other Contests</a></h3>

        <p>Competitive programming has becoming very popular in recent years and
        so there are now many programming contests. <a
          href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a> host a number of
        contests, although none are between our first and final rounds. <a
          href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc">TopCoder</a> has weekly algorithm
        contests, which are only 75 minutes long. There are many more,
        especially once you make it into university level.</p>

        <h2><a name="ioi">International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)</a></h2>

        <p>If you come in a top ranking in the final round then you will enter
        a full training programming at the University of Cape Town. This forms
        the basis of team selection for the IOI and if you make it this far then
        preparation gets a lot more intense.</p>
