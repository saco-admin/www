            <h2><a name="r1">First Round</a></h2>

            <p>
                The first round of SAPO is open for one week in July or August.
                The contest lasts for 1 hour and consists of three questions,
                each containing usually four to six test cases of varying
                complexity. The questions will ask you to write and debug a
                program that solves a given task.
            </p>

            <p>
                This round tests the basic fundamentals of programming. For
                example, if you're familar with if-statements, for loops, while
                loops and basic arrays/lists, then the first round should not be
                much trouble.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2><a name="r2">Second Round</a></h2>

            <p>
                The second round is open on a given day, usually within three
                weeks of Round 1. The contest itself is 2 hours long and
                consists of either three or four questions of a more challenge
                nature than that of the previous round. Each question may
                consist of different subtasks of increasing difficulty. The aim
                of this round is similar to the previous round (write code to
                solve a problem), however this time you will be required to
                submit your code on our
                <a href="../cms/">online evaluator</a>. It therefore must
                produce the exact correct output for every test case in order to
                score full marks.
            </p>

            <p>
                This round goes beyond programming basics and tests elementary
                algorithms and data structures. The sections below outline how
                to prepare for the second round from learning to program to
                mastering the more challenging questions.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r2_python">Learning Python</a></h3>

            <p>
                If you have no experience with programming then Python is a
                great language to start with. If you have learned Java, Pascal
                or Delphi at school, or any other language for that matter, you
                might also be interested in learning Python as a new programming
                language.
            </p>

            <p>
                The free ebook <i>A Byte of Python</i> is targeted at beginner
                programmers (i.e. if you have little or no knowledge of
                programming). You can
                <a href="https://python.swaroopch.com/">read it online</a> or
                <a
                    href="https://www.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/swaroopch/byte-of-python"
                    >download a PDF</a
                >. It covers downloading and installing Python so those
                instructions won't be repeated here.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Dive Into Python</i> is another free ebook, but targeted at
                experienced programmers looking for a rapid jump into Python. It
                is useful if you are already thoroughly understand another
                programming language. You can read it online as a PDF
                <a href="http://histo.ucsf.edu/BMS270/diveintopython3-r802.pdf"
                    >here</a
                >.
            </p>

            <p>
                Using Python in the SAPO after learning it the night before is a
                bad idea!
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r2_practice">Practice</a></h3>

            <p>
                The Computer Olympiad website has a collection of past first and
                second round papers dating back to 2009
                <a
                    href="http://olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/past-papers/school-rounds/"
                    >here</a
                >. Some solutions are available <a href="../old/">here</a>.
                Solving these problems as practice will prepare you well for the
                second round. You should also time yourself, remembering that
                the paper is two hours long.
            </p>

            <p>
                For those who complete all the past second round papers and want
                more challenging problems to practice on, there are plenty of
                such resources! The best place to go is the
                <a href="http://train.usaco.org/usacogate"
                    >USACO Training Program</a
                >, which allows you to progress from easy to very challenging
                problems as well as testing your code against secret test data.
                This is an excellent resource and has several problems with a
                wide range of difficulty.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r2_alg">Algorithms and Data Structures</a></h3>

            <p>
                In the second round, the fourth problem (as well as sometimes
                the third) almost always tests algorithms and/or data
                structures. The USACO Training Program mentioned above has some
                articles as you proceed through the problems. Another useful
                collection of articles on data structures and algorithms is by
                Bruce Merry, the most successful SAPO contestant to date,
                available
                <a href="http://www.brucemerry.org.za/manual/">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r2_advice">General Advice</a></h3>

            <p>
                There are many aspects of contest programming that differ from
                everyday programming. You do <i>not</i> need to check that the
                input matches the constraints -- these are only there to give
                you a guarantee on the input.
            </p>

            <p>
                Time is everything. You only have two hours to solve four
                problems in Round 2. If you think the problems are easy, try
                time yourself while doing one of the past papers. This is where
                Python becomes useful as the code is almost always less than
                half the length of Java or Pascal code. You do not need to go
                for the most complex solution, just one that solves the problem
                for the provided test cases in a reasonable amount of time and
                memory. The fourth (and sometimes also third) problem will
                require a clever solution, even if a brute force solution would
                work on smaller data.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not enough to check that your program works only on the
                example inputs given in the task statement. Also test larger
                test cases (up to the highest values the input can be) as well
                as corner cases (which might not get tested if one only
                generates random test data).
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r2_ask">Ask Questions</a></h3>

            <p>
                The best way to learn is to ask questions. For questions
                regarding administration and general matters, send an e-mail to
                <a href="mailto:info@olympiad.org.za">info@olympiad.org.za</a>.
                For training matters, please approach your IT teacher, or on of
                the many forums that deal with algorithms or specific languages.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h2><a name="r3">Final Round</a></h2>

            <p>
                The top ~12 contestants from the second round are invited to the
                University of Cape Town to participate in the final round of the
                SAPO. This is a lot tougher than the second round, making
                preparation vital.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r3_practice">Practice</a></h3>

            <p>
                There is a large collection of past final round and even more
                challenging training camp problems available
                <a href="../old/">here</a>. There is an online evaluation system
                for the problems going back to 2002 avaiable
                <a href="../cms/">here</a>, where you can submit solutions for
                evaluation. The evaluation system is the same as you will use
                for the final round, so it would be a good idea to become
                familiar with it beforehand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Continue churning through the USACO Training Program mentioned
                above. As you progress you will find that the problems quickly
                reach very challenging levels.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="r3_alg">Algorithms and Data Structures</a></h3>

            <p>
                Algorithms and data structures become far more important in the
                final round. With a decent understanding of dynamic programming
                and graph theory you will do well.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is an archive of presentations from IOI training camps
                available <a href="../presentations/">here</a> as well as a long
                list of algorithm tutorials on

            <p>
                Competitive programming has becoming very popular in recent
                years and so there are now many programming contests.
                <a href="http://usaco.org/">USACO</a> host a number of contests,
                although none are between our first and final rounds.
                <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc">TopCoder</a> has weekly
                algorithm contests, which are only 75 minutes long. There are
                many more, especially once you make it into university level.

            </h2>

            <p>
                If you come in a top ranking in the final round then you will
                enter a full training programming at the University of Cape
                Town. This forms the basis of team selection for the IOI and if
                you make it this far then preparation gets a lot more intense.
